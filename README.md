Brief Description: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control.

Motivation for Project: Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancers. But melanoma is more dangerous because itâ€™s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

In this project we have successfully created a deep learning neural network partly using the Inception-v3 architecture that has been shown to predict more than 90% of real-world test data of Melanoma Skin Cancer Imaging, which is a significant accomplishment, since it is quite difficult to characterize miniscule features and predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign.

Disclaimer: This melanoma prediction model, while achieving high accuracy, should not be relied upon for real-time medical diagnosis or decision-making. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis of any skin condition. AI models are a tool to aid medical professionals but should not replace their expertise and clinical judgment.
